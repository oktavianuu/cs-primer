Option 1:
    - Model the state as the state of the board
    - e.g. 3x3 array of arrays with player tokens for each item
    - New moves are entered as (x, y) coords
    - New moves are valid if array location is empty
    - ...how to compute victory?
    - Printing the board is basically printing the state
    - Maybe we also store who is the current player
    - Would we need to be able to undo move?
    - We wouldn't be able to reply the game? Or save partial game in a database and continue?

Option 2:
    - Model the state as the sequence of moves
